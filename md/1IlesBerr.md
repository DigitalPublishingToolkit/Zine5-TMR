# The Exploitation of Isolation: Urban Development and the Artist’s Studio

### Josephine Berry & Anthony Iles 

1.  Have you heard about this house

    > Inside, a thousand voices talk

    > And that talk echoes around and around

    > The windows reverberate

    > The walls have ears

    > A thousand saxophone voices talk

    > You should hear how we syllogize

    > You should hear

    > About how Babel fell and still echoes away,

    > How we idolize,

    > Theorize

    > Syllogize

    > In the dark,

    > In the heart

    > –Pere Ubu, ‘Dub Housing’

In 2010, in the wake of the 2007 subprime and 2008 financial crisis we
wrote, No Room to Move: Radical Art in the Regenerate City, a book which
assessed the growing role of public art in urban design in the United
Kingdom post-1945 and involved discussions with contemporary artists
critical of urban regeneration processes.[^1IlesBerr_1] We anticipated that the
cultural benefits promised by regeneration schemes would be
progressively dumped in the era of austerity, as the developers’ naked
profit principle became an acceptable and open objective, positioning
artists increasingly as collateral rather than agents of urban change,
and art became a vernacular veneer to be cloned by developers and local
authority bureaucrats alike.

However, the reignition of the housing market triggered by the subprime
crisis blew away even our worst expectations. The wholesale
commodification of urban space in the, by now very much global, city of
London, which rapidly escalated the economic crisis into the current
housing crisis, has impacted artists’ living conditions, working
conditions, art practice and the public display of art more
generally.[^1IlesBerr_2] Yet how is the spatial precarity that has resulted from
this unprecedented transformation of real estate into the main lever of
the British economy, and worsened by austerity, made legible in the
field of contemporary art? In other words, how does a scarcity of space
or spatial scarcity – which, as a fundamental use value necessarily
affects all of social production and reproduction – become a directly
legible influence on art, both historically and today, and with what
effects? The intensifying struggle over housing and workspace must
surely manifest in art’s internal development as much as in the more
externally legible forms of social contestation and organization that
involve – but as often implicate – artists. Here, therefore, we attempt
to construct a brief overview of the relationship between the urban mode
of production, the studio, the social figure of the artist and the
nature of their practice.

Here we continue to develop a framework by which we understand art as
developing both in relation to and distinction from capitalism’s spatial
fixes.[^1IlesBerr_3] In David Harvey’s analysis, capitalism both fixes space for
value production, and then later disaggregates it in order to provide
for new areas of innovation, opportunity and profit.[^1IlesBerr_4] Capital’s needs
for transportation, communication and storage structure space and the
environment.[^1IlesBerr_5] In the post-war period, particularly under the
pressures of reconstruction, this restructuring was undertaken by the
state as a unified programme of public works, within which art was
integrated, for the first time, as exceptional and autonomous, serving
the purpose of no purpose e.g. spiritually edifying public art, albeit
within a context tailored to the needs of industrial capitalist
development.[^1IlesBerr_6] Later, capital’s need for spatial fixes become the
response to crises of overaccumulation and temporary solutions to the
destructive effects of competition – driving the ‘annihilation of space
by time’[^1IlesBerr_7] – achieved by earlier revolutions in transport and
communications.[^1IlesBerr_8] Spatial commodification develops from being a
corollary of industrial development with some speculative outcomes
(railways and real estate in the 19th century) into a core area of
accumulation[^1IlesBerr_9] in the late-20th and early 21st centuries due to the
increasing prominence of global finance. It is through this dynamic,
according to Michael Hudson[^1IlesBerr_10] and Loren Goldner,[^1IlesBerr_11] that finance
ceases to serve investment in productive industry and becomes the
central motor of (and in fact barrier to) development as
financialization determines the form through which first corporations,
then almost all enterprises of every form and function, both large and
small, reproduce themselves. Within this emergent field of intense
global competition between cities, vying to solicit investment from the
swarm of nomad dollars[^1IlesBerr_12] seeking profit worldwide, urbanization
becomes a key mediator,[^1IlesBerr_13] and art is at stake within it because as
Harvey argues, ‘claims to uniqueness and authenticity can best be
articulated as distinctive and non-replicable cultural claims.’[^1IlesBerr_14]
This provides us with the credible linkages between finance and
urbanization which help to structure our framework, as well as the
periodization of art within capital’s self-development.

Here, we prioritize the studio as a spatial container within which the
current production conditions of art are crystallized. The studio offers
a window onto the life of the artist in all its distinctness from other
working practices in the city which makes it highly desirable to
processes of commodification. It is also a spatial frame that allows us
to track the totality of the artist’s activities. Therefore, the studio
presents a surface upon which are etched capitalist financialization’s
desires for exemplary creative practices, embodied in artists, and at
the same time, the minimum conditions required by artists to actually
create work. By tracking the historical transformations of the artist’s
studio we can illuminate the impact of the changing mode of urban
production on the figure and practices of artists and thereby sharpen
our reading of the effects of spatial crisis on art today. Within this
we understand art’s negotiation of its spatial conditions as a struggle
to both reproduce the artist and reproduce art. This is not commensurate
with class struggle, but, given art’s difference from processes of
capitalization – art is neither defined directly by socially necessary
labor nor utility,[^1IlesBerr_15] and derives its force through a critical remove
fro[]{#bookmark=id.gjdgxs .anchor}m the status quo of any given societal
formation[^1IlesBerr_16] – art’s spatial struggles overlap both with other
struggles for social reproduction and critiques developed by
antisystemic movements.

## Five Stages in the Studio’s Genealogy

1.  

In order to set art’s defining relationship to finance in a broader
historical context and to tease out this and other factors structuring
its relationship to space and the city, we have constructed a
comparative genealogy of the artist’s studio in modernity. As Daniel
Buren commented in 1979: ‘Analysis of the art system must inevitably be
carried on in terms of the studio as the unique space of production and
the museum as the unique space of exposition.’[^1IlesBerr_17] If, as a man of his
institution-critical times, Buren focused on exposing the studio’s
continuity with the museum as the artwork’s intended destination and
implicit limit condition, we will adapt this connective approach to our
own times, replacing the museum with the city.

The museum, as a space apart, functioned as a laboratory for
concentrating knowledge during the Enlightenment as well as reflecting
the rigid divisions of production within the first phase of capitalism.
But within post-Fordism, the city becomes the factory (of creative labor
and financial self-valorization) and the crucible of knowledge
production which, like the brain itself, thrives on its multiplicity of
interactions.[^1IlesBerr_18] If we want to read the studio as a vessel connecting
the (financialized) transformation in shifting production conditions to
changing conceptions of art and its exhibition which accompany this
process, it then becomes necessary to formulate a genealogy in keeping
with Michel Foucault’s epistemological strategy.

Drawing histories is emphatically not, he argued, about creating
consoling continuities between the past and the present moment wherein
we rediscover ourselves, but rather a way to ‘introduce discontinuity
into our very being’, to uproot our presuppositions. ‘This’, he
concludes, ‘is because knowledge is not made for understanding; it is
made for cutting.’[^1IlesBerr_19] By returning to the past we want to emphasize
that history is not only a knife to cut backwards through time, but also
forwards into the virtual futures stored in the present. In presenting
the following brief genealogy of historical models of the studio, we
want to emphasize not only what has changed, but also the many
historical elements which persist within current studio culture and
architecture. While these presiding elements inform the condition of the
contemporary studio, they gain a new function and meaning under present
conditions, bearing only a resemblance to their former identity.

## The Isolated Studio (c.1800 – 1950)

1.  

The isolated studio arises with the modern metropolis and the
solidification of capitalist society with processes of urbanization. It
is a cell, withdrawn from but surrounded by the bustle of the city.
Often situated at the city’s fringes or derelict zones, partially rural
or pastoral in character, it is the situation of the existential artist,
laboring over their metier in retreat.[^1IlesBerr_21] Yet, though the studio may
contain a particle of the pastoral, its eyrie-like remove from the city
also provided a vantage point from which to reflect upon and unveil its
mysteries. The studio exacts its charge precisely from its distant
proximity to the people and things that bustle and bristle past. From
it, art springs out to bring revelations about urban life into
appearance. In early post-studio artist Daniel Buren’s condensation:

1\. It is the place where the work originates.

2\. It is generally a private place, an ivory tower perhaps.

3\. It is a stationary place where portable objects are produced.

\[...\] the studio is a place of multiple activities: production,
storage, and

finally, if all goes well, distribution. It is a kind of commercial
depot.[^1IlesBerr_22]

Although modern artists, such as Edouard Manet and Claude Monet, made
forays into the city and country, to paint en plein air, they set out
from the studio or reassembled it outdoors (Monet had his Bateau Atelier
so he could paint the light-industrial river life at Argenteuil),
returning to the isolated studio to complete their work. By the mid-19th
century, the artist’s studio perhaps already began to seem like a
colonial outpost or hunting hide from which to launch explorations into
the unknown and increasingly far-flung territories generated by the
dynamic forces of finance’s first urban transformations. Indeed, it was
Baron von Haussmann’s credit-fueled redevelopment of Paris (1853-1870)
that pushed out manufacturing and the working classes from the city
center, creating industrial suburbs such as Argenteuil (where Monet
lived and worked), Courbevoie, and Asnières-sur-Seine (where Seurat
painted factory workers relaxing) whose hybridization of gritty
industrial production and pleasure seeking fascinated the
Impressionists. As the old artisanal quarters were dismantled, where
housing and manufacture had mixed and self-organized along with the
classes, they were replaced by the repetitive uniformity of the new
Paris – kiosk, bench, street-lamp, kiosk, bench, street-lamp –
ubiquitously evoking industrial standardization and efficiency, not to
mention a more rigid spatial division of classes. We can trace the
consequences of early financialization’s spatializing effects in the
siting of the Impressionist studio within the new suburban peripheries,
the intensification of speed and mobility, and the attention to the
drama of class differences in their paintings.

With the old quarters and lifestyles gone, there was a brash
proletarianization of the freshly built public sphere producing a
caustic shock to bourgeois sensibilities and, it should be added,
creating perhaps the most important subject of 19th century painting and
writing. The shock is tangible in the following diary entry by the
bohemian bourgeois Goncourt brothers of 18 November 1860:

Our Paris, the Paris where we were born, the Paris of the way of life of
1830 to 1848, is passing away. Its passing is not material but moral.
Social life is going through a great evolution, which is beginning. I
see women, children, households, families in this café. The interior is
passing away. Life turns back to become public. The club for those on
high, the café for those below, that is what society and the people are
come to.[^1IlesBerr_23]

The first speculative housing boom was paid at the cost of the
displacement and broken autonomy of the city’s working class, but it
also unleashed the anomic bacchanal of mass leisure, giving the petit
bourgeois new standing in a reborn public realm. While this mass
appearance certainly led to the temporally disjointed flâneur and the
probing bateau atelier,[^1IlesBerr_24] it caused an equal and opposite reaction,
necessitating the romantic retreat into the existential gloom of the
studio in which modernity’s headlong transformations could be sifted and
digested as art. If artists could be existentially gloomy, however, it
was because their studios afforded at least some privacy; the very thing
that will become unavailable in the neoliberal city’s cloning of the
artist’s atelier and developers’ penchant for large glazed facades
behind which there is no place to hide and for which there are no
curtains big enough! But 19th century Parisian gloom was perhaps more
psychological than architectural since it was there, between 1900 and
the 1930s, that the maison atelier or studio-house[^1IlesBerr_25] was invented
with its top-floor studios and large windows with living quarters
below.[^1IlesBerr_26] The atelier model of light, spacious and multipurpose living
spaces would be integrated into modernist open-plan principles of design
(e.g. Le Corbusier’s Unité d’Habitation, 1947-1952), driving a
reimagination of lifestyle that has underwritten middle class
appropriations of loft living from the 1970s until today.

## The Factory Studio (1962-1989)

1.  

Warhol’s Factory studio helped pioneer the appropriation of former
industrial space by artists in Manhattan as the city stepped up its
planned displacement of industry.[^1IlesBerr_28] The studio as factory expresses a
dual process of the western city’s deindustrialization and art’s
experimental reimagination of itself as participating in general
production: collective, industrial, site-sensitive, gendered,
prototyped, banalised, libidinal, democratic and mediatized. The factory
studio was a space for collapsing distinctions between art and
production, art and life, art and technological reproduction – a
laboratory for the contestation of art’s distinction per se and the
creation of large-scale, dirty, genre shifting, commerce courting,
performative and intermedia works. For the generation that followed the
Abstract Expressionists, the factory studio became a space not only for
the reinvention of art, but for the reinvention of the self, which in
turn was framed as art and put on display: ‘In the mid- to late sixties,
for example, the Conceptualists presented the process of making art as a
work of art in itself.’[^1IlesBerr_29] In this phase, the neo-avant-garde renewed
art by challenging its originality, individualism, sexism and class
elitism. The factory was therefore a space of liberated production in
which to launch attacks on the lazy presumptions of an art system that
had been embalmed within the museum and bourgeois class interests. The
bones of working-class production were danced on, not in the sense that
artists directly displaced industrial labor, but rather that their
joyful occupation of these decommissioned spaces examined and overturned
many of the social divisions that industrial production presupposes.

Artists also organized, as ‘Art Workers’, on the model of industrial
labor but not (primarily) to ‘campaign about wages or working
conditions’,[^1IlesBerr_30] but instead to radically contest the disaster of
bourgeois capitalism, racism, war and technocracy.[^1IlesBerr_31] From Pop, to
Performance and Land Art, artists were at pains to make explicit the
relationships between art and commodification, art and the forces of
production (industrial, administrative, cybernetic, heteropatriarchal).
Like a can of soup, artworks could be generated by the dozen, sold by
the yard, and everyone could be a celebrity for 15 minutes. Equally, the
productive power of the factory could be desublimated, its repetitions
and intense energies hijacked to produce new experimental gyrations of
thought, sex, art, music and performance. Its expanse of largely
unarticulated space provided an (almost) blank sheet for rearranging the
conventions of living, working and creating (live/work).

One of the most ambitious artists’ housing projects, George Macunius’
Fluxhouse Cooperatives (1966 to 1975), crosses over with Warhol’s
Factory, sharing the conditions of New York’s deindustrialization in the
late ’60s and early ’70s, but put them to use under a very different
model. Whilst Warhol’s Factory has latterly been celebrated as a living
artwork and business model, Fluxhouse Cooperatives were conceived as a
multiple from the beginning. They were a bohemian capitalist fantasy of
a communist cooperative trading under the name Fluxus Cooperative
Inc.[^1IlesBerr_32] Maciunas imagined Fluxhouses or the Fluxcity (of which the
coops were the basic building blocks to be multiplied and scaled-up) as
a Kolkhoz (collective estate). Yet the pragmatism of negotiating New
York’s zoning laws and the difficulty of raising finance meant this was
to become only replicable on an individualist and increasingly
capitalized basis by an incoming middle class and the developers that
followed hard on their heels.

For a short period during the 1960s and early 1970s then, Loft
Living,[^1IlesBerr_33] was a cheap fix for artists and a radical new way to think
about creating and living in the city – one that inspired many
imitators. Zukin argues, however, that through the growing willingness
of artists to present their work in their place of both living and work,
‘consumption of art in the artists’ studio developed into a consumption
of the studio too.’[^1IlesBerr_34] This appropriation of the studio by the middle
class meant that an inadvertent outcome of performance and conceptual
art was ‘the success of the studio’ itself. The studio became a coveted
model for metropolitan living. After artists had appropriated the spaces
freed up by displaced industrial work, a new middle class in turn
struggled for the same spaces, turning the ex-industrial into a booming
property category. The studio loft has become a key urban trope,
reappearing in modulated form in all subsequent cycles of
post-industrial real estate boom and bust (1980s, 1990s and 2000s). On
the other hand the gentrification process that ensued produced shared
conditions between artists and low income residents in the fallout zones
of capital’s reoccupation of the inner city and this was generative of
new struggles and solidarities around housing and space, notably in
NYC’s Lower East Side.[^1IlesBerr_35]

## Open or Community Studio (1966-Now)

1.  

Open or community studios took hold where the concentration of
marginalized (classed and raced) people met with conditions of economic
decline and urban dilapidation. A phenomenon known as spatial
concentration whose crisis point was reached in the 1950s in western
cities and which would quickly reverse into spatial
deconcentration;[^1IlesBerr_36] a term which we use here to describe complex
migratory processes such as white middle class suburbanization in the US
and, in the UK, the planned working class displacement from major cities
to new towns.[^1IlesBerr_37] The open studio registers and responds to the assault
on and abandonment of urban communities left in the wake of these
processes. In the US the Black Arts Movement built on the radical
political premise that the ‘ghetto itself is the gallery’[^1IlesBerr_38] by
establishing theatres, concert halls, rehearsal spaces, exhibition
spaces, art and music studios in largely black and poor areas of the
inner city.[^1IlesBerr_39] The venues generated served as the platform for a
rapidly developing ethos of community arts, characterized by the attempt
to deflect specialist audiences in favor of direct and immediate
community provision. In the UK such spaces and the community arts they
supported ‘dated back to the 1960s and were associated with alternative
bookshops, theatre groups and the so-called Arts Laboratories that had
succeeded in attracting new, younger audiences’.[^1IlesBerr_40] But after an Arts
Council report (1974) the logic of community arts was formalised and
increasingly attracted fine artists and professional protagonists
together with an expanding list of media artists.[^1IlesBerr_41] These arts
‘spaces’ drew upon infrastructures and funding streams which were the
legacy of the post-World War II welfare state (e.g. public health and
community education), they were often open air, flexible, temporary or
mobile, and more informal than the traditional studio or gallery.

1.  

Most community artists had a base or ‘resource centre’ for their
operations (sometimes a mobile one) and employed a variety of
facilities, media and techniques – dance, drama and writing classes,
festivals, inflatables, murals, performance, photography, printing
presses, play structures, video – which they used to foster public
participation and to teach skills.[^1IlesBerr_42]

1.  

In the UK, as the attempt to take art to the people faltered along with
post-war optimism, the modus operandum of community arts increasingly
fused with engaged and post-conceptual art taking it into the classroom
(as in Central St. Martin’s ‘A’ Class), the hospital (Loraine Leeson &
Peter Dunn) as well as the factory and prison (Artist Placement
Group).[^1IlesBerr_44] Later, during the 1980s, a period of austerity, cutbacks to
welfare provision and state retrenchment, the same inner-city areas
where community arts had become integrated into local state service
provision and funding became sites of spatial deconcentration, i.e. the
breaking up of the ghetto and gentrification of working class
areas.[^1IlesBerr_45]

In Africa, group practices such as Laboratoire AGIT Art in Senegal and
Huit Facettes established community studio projects in both urban and
rural situations as responses to the harsher social climate and
degenerating prospects for critical art created by Structural Adjustment
Programmes.[^1IlesBerr_46] The community or open studio tended to embed itself
within sites of social reproduction, but as that is disaggregated, then
to respond to and encompass a situation of actual or perceived spatial
dispersion. Whilst poor or poorly maintained housing would be a central
theme throughout this moment, the exhibition, display, performance or
presentation of art tends towards the street or local public realm. In
the West, as working class people began to be displaced from areas where
community resources had helped develop their autonomy (buildings,
squats, social centers), community arts took to the street, often
framing the struggles for self-determination and the bathos of economic
survival on the breadline as resistant creativity.

[]{#bookmark=id.tyjcwt .anchor}

The community studio’s spirit of improvisation and spatial repurposing
was gradually incorporated into the governmental push for a non-stop
programme of visitor-friendly arts festivals whose presence marks a
wider geopolitical competition over place making, cultural tourism and
inward investment. For those communities who initiated these
participatory practices, the managerial turn in cultural commissioning
replicates a more widespread shift in the nature of power which claims
to speak in the name of the voiceless, vapidly invoking communities
while divesting them as a source of meaning making from their own
representations.[^1IlesBerr_47] The authentic community studio lives and dies with
the waning of universal provision and in inverse relation to the rise of
built space as high rent-yielding private property. With declining
social tenure and public ownership tracking an exponential rise of
community arts, the community studio has all but disappeared, retreating
to bedroom production and the corporate ghettos of social media.

## The Networked Studio (1989–present)

1.  

The administrative and informational aesthetics pioneered by 1960s
factory-based conceptual artists and inspired by cybernetics and
communication technologies, would reemerge in the ubiquitous office
metaphor that was incorporated into the computer desktop and popularized
by the Apple Macintosh from 1984.[^1IlesBerr_48] Turing’s universal machine was to
produce a new spatial topology in which art can pass as – and be
mistaken for – generic labor within the cybernetic society. To the
casual observer, computer use by artists is largely indistinguishable
from that of a service worker, journalist, architect or engineer. The
conceptual techniques of the 1960s were eventually reassembled and
compacted in the 1990s network studio and the figure of the immaterial
laborer.[^1IlesBerr_49] The isolated studio does not necessarily move position but
becomes increasingly networked by communications technologies, services,
changing terms of building insurance, health & safety specifications,
and the further development of financial claims which feed the growth of
tertiary industries and bureaucracies. The artist in the networked
studio responds to the limits breached by their precursors who collapsed
the divisions active in wider society and, in the first wave, overlapped
significantly with the DIY community spirit of the open studio artist.
The network studio camouflages itself in a number of guises be that the
office, the artist’s loft, the hacklab, social center, cybercafé or
simply the portable laptop. We can therefore position the network studio
as having an uncertain, deceptive and possibly anxious relationship to
built space. This can be connected to a double movement, identifiable
within its brief history, of artists occupying spaces that advertise
their networked infrastructures and those that dissemble them within the
shell of the old city.

The networked studio in its most extreme form is the mobile home that
the infonaut carries with them through their connection to the network.
The early network artist affirmed spatial precarity as digital nomadism
like it was a blessing. This 1990s affirmation of the network as a
replacement of fixed spatial relations tended towards the production of
singular, albeit hybrid spaces (eg. London’s Backspace, Ljubljana’s
Ljudmila, New York’s Rhizome, and Zagreb’s MaMa), in which artists built
assemblages of hard- and software to explore and magnify the dawning
universal space/time of the internet. The network studio provides a
place to tune into and amplify an increasingly chaotic out there. The
most iconic example of this was perhaps the Makrolab (1994-2007),
devised by the Slovenian artist Marko Peljhan, who had grown up in
non-aligned Yugoslavia listening to CB radio and transposed the
experience of remote and isolated listening to the noise of the
information age.[^1IlesBerr_50] The Makrolab was a mobile communications
monitoring hub that looked like a space-pod and moved between ever more
isolated places gathering the public and monitoring the often secret or
invisible telecommunications exchanges of incipient global capitalism.

This mobility, however, also presages the impending spatial precarity of
the millennium in which to survive is to keep moving on, to ‘replace
\[…\] the inevitability of being uprooted with the strategy of pitching
and breaking camp’, as the urban stickering campaign of
artist-collective Inventory had it (Inventory, 1999–2002). It is
striking that the isolation Makrolab achieved was underwritten by the
same forces of globalization that its periscopes peered at; not only
satellites, cables, deep dishes, antennas and data flows but, indirectly
at least, the transnational investment strategies of George Soros and
his Open Society Institute.[^1IlesBerr_51] Thus, the networked utopia of the
artist-infonaut dovetailed beautifully with the migratory practices that
would be the prerequisite of globalization’s ‘race to the bottom’, and
in this sense the mobile isolation of the studio can be seen as an
analogue to the precarious and alienated status of the worker within the
new world order, the so-called digital nomad.[^1IlesBerr_52]

The appearance of the digital avant-garde also coincides with the advent
of the last great real estate boom, (in the UK and US), of which we are
yet to see the end. In this moment artists, often collectively, obtained
workspace in the inner city if only for a brief while. These digital
artisans were often artists who moonlighted as web designers and could
be found producing artistic and commercial work on the same machine at
the same desk. To the office workers next door, their activity was
indistinguishable from white-collar work. While at first the network
studio had projected itself as an anomaly amidst the commercial zones of
the city, this possibility was rapidly eradicated by rising rents based
upon projections of burgeoning commercial demand. The network studio was
soon to give way to businesses that understood themselves as creative in
themselves. Characteristic of the new format of businesses moving into
fill these spaces were built-in signifiers of leisure (ping pong tables,
bean bags, office pets, drinks trolleys, beer taps, house plants)
incorporated into the new corporate aesthetic. The technology which
denizens of the networked studio had experimented with swiftly began to
reconfigure the space between previously separated spheres, not least
labor and creativity. The playful ‘hacking’ of the social outcomes of
computer technologies, now incorporated into a host of new business
models, gave way to a calculative logic bearing down on what had
previously remained uncalculated, profoundly disrupting the social
through understanding it as a field available for continuous commercial
speculation. Now profits could be sought through the elimination of
space/time between those previously discreet social forms, objects,
sites and resources within a ‘becoming topological of culture’ in which
any data point can be connected to any other.[^1IlesBerr_53] The integration of
cybernetics with a competitive and reifying economic logic (sorting,
ranking, data-banking, locating, connecting) unleashes a ubiquitous
entrepreneurialism based on processes of disintermediation. Through
disintermediation, points in space, along with buyers and sellers, can
be connected in new ways that undermine older spatio-temporal
exclusivities. This opening of the social field to disruptive
reconfigurations fed into the emergence, in the late 1990s, of an
entrepreneurial subject constantly on the look-out for commercial
opportunities (and venture capital) within new and unstable proximities,
be that physical, resource-based or both.[^1IlesBerr_54] Within this new paradigm,
the operator of the network studio, who had up to this point sought to
dissolve their distinction in the hybrid commercial-cultural spaces of
the city and the internet,[^1IlesBerr_55] made a counter-movement, seeking
instead, against the creeping creative branding of the dot com economy
to claim the distinction of art and the activity of the artist. The
networked studio began to disappear as all studios became digitally
networked-by-default. The chaos that deregulated transnational
capitalism unleashed in the form of financialization and labour force
restructuring would be converted, at an urban scale, into the blow-down
of social housing estates and the vertical eruption of steel and glass
office blocks in which there is no longer hope of stable and affordable
studio space. The networked studio can be seen as the early warning
signal for the studio’s permanent ungrounding.

## The Pop-up Studio (2000–2020)

1.  

The post-conceptual artist doesn’t need a studio just as much as they
can no longer have a studio. Nonetheless the studio picks itself up and
walks on its own two feet, apparently popping-up in new and
pre-fabricated pseudo-public spaces. It is a creature of municipally-led
regeneration schemes that imitates and fuses with a prior moment of
artist’s self-organized exploitation of tenancy breaks in commercial
properties, such as Tracy Emin and Sarah Lucas’ The Shop on Brick Lane
(1993). By this point, the isolated studio is not just surrounded by the
networks of urban financialization, but directly integrated into their
centers of development.

The pop-up studio is now a developer-led must-have for any land subject
to speculative investment or seeking it. This speculative function of
the studio is symptomized in the highly visible nature of these spaces
of exception in which, regardless of actual requirements, glazed
shop-fronts are installed, flashy signage and bright colors deployed,
and artists expected to charismatically perform like artists no matter
how dryly conceptual, computer based, post-studio or socially engaged
their practice might be. In actuality, the pop-up studio is so
integrated into the endo-colonial process of urban transformation that
it is more isolated from both the artist’s own agency and the social
than ever. It comprises a significant push for art’s role in incubating
obsolescent spaces driven by both small arts organizations (or the
microentrepreneurs steering them) and government policy. Pop-ups,
meanwhile spaces, space ache, pop-up retail, interim spaces, slack
spaces emerge as a new language directly after the 2007/8 financial
crisis. The group Meanwhile Space pioneered the mediation between empty
spaces, money-saving councils and investors on the prowl.[^1IlesBerr_56] ‘Empty
spaces are a blight to communities, a financial drain to owners and
stimulate wider civic problems. To us they are an opportunity’.[^1IlesBerr_57] The
pop-up has a specific temporality, its presuppositions are set by the
speculative proposition that empty space will become realizable value
and in turn it assists this prediction into becoming reality. Realizing
the age-old logic of crisis as an opportunity, the pop-up also operates
through art-without-qualities to arrive at the consensus that anything
can pop-up but, as the rents rise, anything increasingly tends to look
like some form of commerce. This may be the first time that the studio
as a form fully precedes, presupposes and overcodes the activities of
artists.

The pop-up is shot through with contingencies, requirements and
conditions: a fixed creativity ratio prescribed in the developer’s plan
with the space allocated through competition. Its exceptionality
provides the necessary association with excellence its commercial
sponsors require.[^1IlesBerr_58] Practice in the pop-up studio is transparent like
a fishbowl, intended to be viewed, visited and displayed. A space in
which artistic labor is as performative as it is absorptive. Whether
it’s filled with cupcakes or high-end abstraction this will be a
conspicuously ethical performance, in which the performer fails to
notice the conditionality their striving imposes on everyone else. What
masquerades as inclusivity is in fact the conduit to exclusivity. But,
given there is no specifically identifiable characteristic of pop-up
art, who is the pop-up practitioner?[^1IlesBerr_59]

The pop-up studio is therefore: ‘a very vexatious thing full of
metaphorical subtlety and theological perversity’.[^1IlesBerr_60] Behind a
smokescreen of community it puts a young, precarious, flexible
demographic to work as quisling managers, ‘trusted middle persons’.[^1IlesBerr_61]
Their agency from the point of view of local government is that they
stage a public which isn’t the public local government is usually bound
to provide services to. This trusted middle mediates interests which are
closer to those of developers and international investors than those of
artists or the community in whose name the spaces are contrived.[^1IlesBerr_62]
The pop-up people are then the front of house and community liaison for
a back room that is selling off the entire house.

[]{#bookmark=id.3dy6vkm .anchor}

Now that pop-up retail is the norm, it is easy to forget the form’s
origins as a local authority strategy of allocating properties managed
by them to temporary housing or community use. Throughout the 1970s
short life housing had been both a means of alleviating housing need,
and meeting demands for space for a wide range of emergent community
needs in the face of local authorities’ squandering of empty and
decaying public property.[^1IlesBerr_63] The pop-up has represented some sort of
survival of the studio situation for artists and therefore also the
short-life strategy, (even for those who end up refusing the
instrumental roles imposed upon them in situ).[^1IlesBerr_64] Through the
intensification of property guardianship schemes after the 2008 property
market crash many artists obtained live/work studios in former local
authority housing. It is in just such a situation that photographer, Rab
Harling, property guardian for Bow Arts Trust, turned his lens on the
estate and his activist proclivities towards the peculiar public-private
arrangements which had led to the eviction of both tenants and
leaseholders previously living on the estate. At the Balfron Tower,
artists and residents worked together to expose and block two
particularly offensive public art works synonymous with the excesses of
public art in regeneration.[^1IlesBerr_65] Public art commissioning agency,
Artangel, who site new major commissions in edgy locations, may be
considered pioneers of pop-up art which parasites off and re-encodes
blighted spaces. The resulting temporary artworks often function to
rebrand an area or iconic building by socializing the site differently,
drawing the attention of those deemed most likely to invest in its
future. With artists often working in situ, such commissioning
approaches have arguably prepared the ground for the pop-up studio sited
temporarily in the midst of development zones, whose users are
encouraged to make work as visibly as possible and regularly offered
ad-hoc exhibition opportunities until the available space dries up.

[]{#bookmark=id.1t3h5sf .anchor}

Viewed retrospectively, after the cycle beginning with the financial
crisis of 2007-2008, the pop-up was a moment in these former places’
violent transport onto the open market. Striking here is how it is now
the council flat or residential estate that has become newly designated
as a (temporary) site of studio production or artistic intervention. In
the same way that industrial spaces were planned out of the city in the
1960s, curtailing their actual utility, financialized urban
development’s need for new sites of value extraction chaotically
inflicts long-term obsolescence on entire communities and their homes
producing only short-lived opportunities for artists. This constitutes a
total inversion of avant-garde modernism’s dreams of masterplanning the
city, with artists no longer employed as visionaries but rather
encouraged to pick over the bones of social housing provision.

The house, whether in the form of the evacuated single terraced British
House (Rachel Whiteread, 1993) or the housing estate maps refined
through painterly abstraction, as Estate Maps (Keith Coventry,
1991-1995), became a central motif of art in the UK at a moment when the
model of habitation seemed at once connected to geopolitical change and
reflective of the waning of artistic modernism and a microcosm of wider
social antagonisms. If 1990s houses in art were ciphers for a mourning
of the past or for socialism, the late-2000s placement of artists in
former local authority housing would produce critical meditations on the
image of the house and the social question of housing (Jessie Brennan,
2015-ongoing and Laura Oldfield Ford, 2008-ongoing) as well as some very
public moments of hubris as artistic ambition met with raw discontent
over housing poverty and the mistreatment of tenants facing estate
regeneration (Mike Nelson, 2013). The small number of artists who
revolted against these grotesque conditions from inside them to expose
exactly how they were not inevitable or natural, were making and
inventing politics where they had been effaced as much as a critical art
where a feebler sibling was intended to emerge.[^1IlesBerr_66] Looking back from
2009 to the present, this is one of the few perspectives from which
housing privatization, art, space and property enter into a fully
antagonistic and dynamic entanglement by which art’s critical
relationship to society is exercised and developed.

## Conclusions

1.  

If, throughout modernity, succeeding generations of artists dreamed of
accelerating both thought and creation to the tempo of technological
production they could not but fail. The paintbrush’s pursuit of
fugitivity moved at a slower pace than the steam age, while the
Futurists’ ecstatic white-heat left the terrestrial assembly line in the
dust. Temporal non-coincidence with prosaic production has been inherent
to art, whether intentionally or not, for centuries. Yet the artist’s
requirement to pop-up, fill-in, engage and performatively be there,
evidences an inescapable synchrony with the accelerated and aimless
cycles of creation and destruction, bubble and burst, borne of
financialization.

That Mayor Sadiq Khan’s recent London Plan calls for the provision of
permanent spaces for artists is more an indication of the problem than a
sign of its solution.[^1IlesBerr_67] The pecuniary provision of such spaces echoes
the exceptionality that art still monopolizes while in practice
poisoning it at the roots, since it entails the creation of special
protections for existing studio spaces and thereby imposes requirements
on art to do something in return for its permission to exist. The studio
as the space of a practice distanced from the rest of life seems to be
facing extinction, either because it’s unaffordable, it now lies too far
from home, or its occasional possibility of fulfilling the terms of its
conditions overwhelms practice altogether. But if the gulf between an
earlier womb-like isolation and today’s developer-fantasised spectacular
creative performances seems too great to retain art as their common
denominator or outcome, there is inevitably a secession from both these
models that is where whatever might actually feel like art is taking
place. This truth is as likely to entail the total obsolescence of the,
in historical terms, relatively short-lived model of autonomous art as
to relocate it safely elsewhere. Capitalism’s unending production and
destruction of space has mutated the physical auspices of art’s
production, and those spatial evolutions have likewise driven a
transformation of artistic practices and vice versa. The inhabitation of
available spaces or conduits of production can be said to condition the
dialectic of art’s relationship to the social world as well as artists’
opportunistic infestation of niches of survival. That this process has
itself been converted into the paradigm and lubricant of spatial
prospecting may finally mean that, as with the burning of the earth’s
carbon resources, like life new art is ever more unsustainable. Yet as
we are starting to see, the cannibalization of art by capitalism
engenders encounters between vagrant aesthetics and planetary
dispossession that cannot but unite against the very forces that condemn
them to a plodding nomadism or show pony servitude.

[^1IlesBerr_21]: Buren, ‘The Function of the Studio’. Honoré De Balzac
    immortalised the archetypal inwardness and nobility of the artist’s
    studio in his 1845 short story, ‘The Unknown Masterpiece’. Here is
    the scene where the young painter Nicolas Poussin first encounters
    Master Porbus’s studio: ‘All the light in the studio came from a
    window in the roof, and was concentrated upon an easel, where a
    canvas stood untouched as yet save for three or four outlines in
    chalk. The daylight scarcely reached the remoter angles and corners
    of the vast room; they were as dark as night, but the silver
    ornamented breastplate of a Reiter’s corselet, that hung upon the
    wall, attracted a stray gleam to its dim abiding-place among the
    brown shadows. \[…\]

    The walls were covered, from floor to ceiling, with countless
    sketches in charcoal, red chalk, or pen and ink. Amid the litter and
    confusion of color boxes, overturned stools, flasks of oil, and
    essences, there was just room to move so as to reach the illuminated
    circular space where the easel stood. The light from the window in
    the roof fell full upon Porbus’s pale face and on the ivory-tinted
    forehead of his strange visitor.’ (Honoré De Balzac, ‘The Unknown
    Masterpiece’, 1845, available at:

[^1IlesBerr_25]: The modernist studio-house Zukin refers to is Le Corbusier’s
    Maison-atelier du peintre Amédée Ozenfant, Paris, France, 1922. This
    itself is a significant upscaling of features drawn from 19th
    century light-industrial artisans’ workshops, often located in the
    suburbs and working class areas of Paris, used as live-work studio
    spaces by modernist artists such as Alberto Giacometti, Amadeo
    Modigliani and Pablo Picasso.

[^1IlesBerr_28]: Of course this was not the first foray of artists into the
    factory, in the 1920s Russian constructivists had developed first a
    *laboratory productivism* in the studio before launching themselves
    into *practical work in production*. However, as Maria Gough and
    others' key studies indicate, the artist primarily entered the
    factory either as an educator, designer of products or re-trained
    engineer. See, Maria Gough, *Artist as Producer Russian
    Constructivism in Revolution*, Berkeley, Calif.: Univ. of California

    formation of the Art Workers Coalition and its offshoot, The New

    1970s in terms which bring the politics of labour and art-labour to
    the fore in their complex and contradictory web of associations,
    identifications and disidentifications.

[^1IlesBerr_32]: Revisiting Macunias’s projects in the long recession of the
    2010s, Florian Cramer and Renee Ridgeway discuss how ‘Fluxus was
    just as much an economic as it was an artistic project’ and in
    Macunias’s ambitious projects ‘its performativity and processuality
    were not merely aesthetic but also biopolitical and bioeconomic
    choices that resulted in manic-depressive business cycles.’

    Florian Cramer, ‘Depression: Post-Melancholia, Post-Fluxus,
    Post-Communist, Post-Capitalist, Post-Digital, Post-Prozac’, in Maya
    Tounta ed., *A Solid Injury to the Knees*, Vilnius: Rupert, 2016,
    pp.60-107, p.87. Macunias may be known as the ‘father of SoHo’ i.e.
    gentrification, or one of a handful of artists who halted Robert
    Moses’s expressway from destroying swathes of Lower Manhattan, or
    the progenitor of small but beautiful artists’ cooperative housing
    projects thriving in post-crisis USA presently; what is clear is
    that his successes were not the ones he had intended:

    ‘Maciunas may be seen as an artist whose primary works were economic
    experiments, the lifelong endeavor of translating a communist
    concept of political (= macro) economy into viable micro-economies.
    Projects that boomed and busted, running in perpetual bipolar cycles
    of euphoria and depression. In this sense, Maciunas did not only
    pioneer gentrification but he also preempted the creative dotcom
    economy with its manic-depressive model of incubators and startups.’

    Post-Capitalist, Post-Digital, Post-Prozac’, p.92.

    Makrolab. It is a project that will research isolation strategies:
    how to isolate oneself from society to reflect and see this society
    better. It is an opposite of the usual going into the society and
    trying to change or make things. My thesis is that a small amount of
    people in an isolated and insulated environment with completely open
    possibilities of communication and monitoring of social events, but
    physically isolated, can provide a much faster, further and more
    efficient “call” (?) for social evolution. It is my thesis, not just
    an idea, and I am going to prove it.’ Peljhan quoted in Josephine

    relevant to look at the professional background of elected members
    themselves. According to Paul Watt and Minton, in 2013 just under
    20% of Southwark’s 63 councillors worked as lobbyists, while the
    former leader of the council, Jeremy Fraser, went on to found
    lobbying firm Four Communications, where he was joined by former
    councillor and cabinet member for regeneration Steve Lancashire.
    Equally concerning is the ‘revolving door’ between council employees
    and elected members and developers. For example, Tom Branton was
