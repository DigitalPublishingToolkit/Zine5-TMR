Housing space is a crucial locus of social reproduction, a place where
countless acts of care sustain our lives. Yet capital has forced its way
into our homes, making them a battleground. For decades now, housing
struggles have centered on eviction and foreclosure, along with epidemic
homelessness, the segregation of the urban poor, and generalized
precarization resulting from worldwide privatization and
financialization. These attacks on housing and homes have not gone
unanswered. Among practices of resistance honed in the course of the
struggle are anti-eviction work, rent strikes, and occupations, whether
of land or housing. Struggles have also materialized in informal housing
strategies, acts of housing disobedience and collective organizational
forms, including tenant unions, activist groups and neighborhood
assemblies, drawing on a wide range of political traditions.

It is important to state clearly here that housing struggle is not
confined between the walls of any particular home: it constitutes a
*housingscape* whose distinct processional and situational character
extend its scope and stakes beyond residential accommodation as
such.[^0Introduction_3] Housing is made, unmade, and remade in this locus of
regulation and de-regulation. Within it, housing itself is enacted in
various ways by multiple actors contending for dominance and the right
to a home. Housingscapes are affirmed and contested, produced, and
disrupted in discourses, practices and places, in politics, policy and
social struggle, art and culture. All these factors combine to create
the paradoxes, contradictions, and instabilities of housing as practice
and lived space.

Art is embedded and intermeshed in housingscapes in multiple ways. The
mutation of art into life coincides historically with gradual
assimilation of the home – previously experienced as a semi-private,
semi-sovereign space for the reproduction of life – into capital and the
extractive state. Though art and the question of housing issues have
always intersected, the art of housing struggle emerged in contested
spaces of the struggle for home. To find an outlet for self-expression,
create community spirit and express disagreement, solidarity and call to
mobilization, a people’s art has depicted what communities in struggle
went through. Art makers, whose practices are long-term investment in
sight of political and social struggle openly sided against land and
housing grab.

Yet, a distinct *art of housing struggle* became known in vacant spaces
that appeared in the *transition* from a Fordist to a Post-Fordist model
of housing and wider spatial production. Some artists moved into
studios, homes and other spaces abandoned in the ruins of
industrialization, while others turned their back on crumbling urban
environments and settled in rural communes. Artists eventually became
significant spatial actors, recognized as such not only within the art
world but also in urbanism and real-estate development. This led to a
long and complicated history of struggles for artistic and reproductive
autonomy, struggles against dispossession and artistic or cultural
appropriation whether by the state, elements of civil society or real
estate developers.

In recent years, interest has increased in the relationship between art
and housing crises. Scholars, policy makers, artists, and activists have
begun to address the question in new ways. Meanwhile, many thousands of
messages have been exchanged on social media networks debating the
issues and contradictions of art in housing struggles. These debates
bear witness to the ever-greater difficulty of separating struggles for
decent housing (whether one’s own or other people’s or on a wider
collective level) from the question of art production caught in
mutations between art institutions and real estate. The stake of art in
housing struggles is always someone’s home, always potentially one’s
own. This is precisely what makes it messy and *too connected* to life.
This is why the art of housing struggle incessantly generates polemics:
one after another, an endless series of passionate calls to choose a
side.

Shelter-in-place, self-isolation, stay-at-home and quarantine orders as
default worldwide responses to the COVID-19 pandemic have only augmented
the existing crisis by bringing housing and health care infrastructure
in proximity.[^0Introduction_4] Multiple housing crises have affected both the
production of art and the reproduction of art producers. As working
conditions have become increasingly precarious, access to stable
housing, particularly in large cities, has also dwindled, with direct
consequences for the artistic practice itself. Artists are expected to
draw on their supposed cultural capital to solve the housing crisis, or
to live and work by collaborating with the leading (parasitic) agents of
regeneration, transition, or colonial modernization. In parallel,
artists have formed alliances with oppressed groups, acting as militant
accomplices in housing struggles,[^0Introduction_5] collectively diverting resources
to the protection of their homes and those of others.

Just like art, thought itself lays bare a geography. The art of housing
struggle has historically been theorized most often from the perspective
of the Global North. Knowledge production determines the vocabulary and
grammar of the art of housing struggle, which until now has reflected
the established Global North/South division. [^0Introduction_6] That’s why it is
important to approach knowledge production from another geographical
point of view: from peripheral geographies. How to think the art of
housing struggle from perspectives that were never allowed into
so-called universalism? My answer to this question would be to adopt a
Global East perspective.[^0Introduction_7] Since we’ve always been marginal to debates
but influential when it comes to art, I make a case in this introduction
for the vantage point of this peripheral geography for the art of
housing struggle.[^0Introduction_8]

For many decades now, culture-led urban regeneration has been central to
discussion of art and housing struggle(s). Meanwhile, regeneration of
designated *declining* urban spaces has become a central focus of urban
policy worldwide, with culture promoted as a key means of response to
socio-economic decline. In this context, art is expected to produce
cultural, social, and economic outcomes, to regenerate the hollowed-out
economies of post-industrial cities, and to bind together populations
fragmented by capital’s systemic reproduction of race, ethnic,
religious, national, class, gender, sexual, ableist, geographical
divisions – regardless of a total paucity of evidence that the arts can
perform any of these tasks. The role of art in housing and urban
regeneration reveals its integral involvement in the same ongoing
capitalist mutations that reduce the arts to one more capital input.

One significant development in recent critical discourse is a shift in
attention from culture-led urban regeneration as such to the
identification and criticism of developer-led art, in response to the
ever-greater openness and apparent acceptability of the developers’
undisguised profit motive. Contributors Josephine Berry and Anthony Iles
write: ‘as the developers’ naked profit principle became an acceptable
and open objective, positioning artists increasingly as collateral
rather than agents of urban change, and art became a vernacular veneer
to be cloned by developers and local authority bureaucrats alike.’ The
resulting art resembles what Gregory Sholette called *bare art,* or as
Kim Charnley describes it in the introduction to Shollette’s book
*Delirium and Resistance,*[^0Introduction_10] a ‘new banal obviousness of art’s
subservience to the interest of capital.’ Artists are pushed into this
new real estate art market (or markets) by their precarious position of
artists and the lack of both public and alternative sources of funding
for art production. At the same time, the lack of affordable housing in
some parts of the world has made artists more likely to accept various
unethical sources of housing and studio space, such as property
guardianship on estates undergoing *decanting*, i.e., the clearing-out
of existing tenants to free up the space for higher income
brackets.[^0Introduction_11]

Neither culture-led regeneration nor developer-led art is an entirely
coherent concept. Both terms, however, comprehend the *visionary* idea
of culture and art as catalyst and engine of optimistic urban change.
This vision is embedded in shifting policy driven agendas according to
local context. [^0Introduction_12] In many instances, markedly similar solutions have
been applied to urban issues in the Global East and Global South. In
many countries of the Global South and Global East, culture led-urban
regeneration and developer-led art were introduced by distinctly
neo-colonial means. Worldwide, national public institutions in
collaboration with global private developers, supra-national
institutions, and multinational NGOs are keen to sponsor socially
engaged art projects that promise to perform regenerative tasks.

One example is the *Urban Incubator* project, launched by the
Goethe-Institut in Belgrade, Serbia in 2013. The project was initially
presented as an art-led participative model of urban development,
seeking to improve living conditions in the Savamala neighborhood while
democratizing community decision-making processes. Savamala is a
neighborhood with specific symbolic importance for post-socialist
Serbia. The area is recognized as a site of pre-WWII capitalist
development. During the Socialist experiment it became an industrial and
infrastructural traffic node, while its pre-war buildings were
unmaintained. In the process of capitalist restoration, Savamala became
central to the project of re-establishing continuity with the so-called
golden age of Serbia.[^0Introduction_13]

<br/>


The Goethe-Institut, a German cultural mission, recognized this area as
neglected and offered a Western culture-led regeneration model based on
resolving spatial deficits with creativization and art. Local and
municipal governments supported this project because it was in tune with
their goals of legitimizing the history of Savamala and preparing the
terrain for future investment. The Goethe-Institut issued an open call,
the result of which was that it mostly commissioned Western engaged
artists to regenerate the neighborhood. The appointees assumed de facto
expert roles as urban planners, social workers, ethnographers,
researchers etc., yet few knew anything at all about Savamala.[^0Introduction_15] The
state used the presence of the artists in its promotion of the formerly
declining neighborhood, but it ended the collaboration once the Belgrade
Waterfront mega-project was launched. An association originating in the
earlier project initially sought to provide 1% of the culture promised
by Belgrade Waterfront under the terms of the public-private partnership
with the Eagle Hills company of the UAE. This soon proved impossible.
Critical voices among the artists were silenced in favor of a culture
led by developers and the state, among whose outstanding products is a
24-meter national(istic) monument to Stefan Nemanja (*father of the
Serbian nation*), the work of an artist from Russia.

In (semi)peripheral regions, the practice of regeneration goes hand in
hand with attempts at *modernization* based on Western models, including
drastic overhaul of existing socialist and social structures and the
introduction of new capitalistic economic forms into urban space,
housing, and art world.[^0Introduction_16] Cultural processes that foster the
subordination of the periphery in the capitalist world-system overlap
with a particular developmentalist ideology characterized by a
presumption of the inevitability of historical change and by political
and economic intervention from the Western core. This ideology became
normative within capitalism in the 2000s as a response to the crisis of
Post-Keynesian Economy.

The term ‘developmentalism’ as used here stands both for the ideology of
urban growth and progress with no social consciousness, and for that of
developmentalism as neo-colonial doctrine pledged to Eurocentric
free-market urban development, including the introduction of new
financialized and culturalized forms of housing capitalism in the Global
South and the Global East. However, developmentalism is not unique to
the Global East and the Global South: it also operates within the
internal peripheries of the Global North, where the same logic was used
to dismantle the *social condensers,*[^0Introduction_17] built under the pressure of
the well-organized post-WWII working class. Within this process, artists
and art take the role of the development agents, called on to perform a
particular function which often involves tasks assigned in places wholly
unknown to those accepting them.

The artists are called into sites with names like *regeneration sites*,
*modernization projects*, *transitional landscapes*. Often these are the
sites where gentrification is played out, with the urban poor, the
working class and black and brown communities displaced to make room for
the relatively affluent. ‘Development-led art’ is a new composite term.
I want to propose it here because it connotes both culture-led
regeneration *and* developer-led art aspirations, and because it
reconnects universalist claims built into these concepts to the ongoing
social reality. The term refers to an art practice integrated into
neo-colonial real-estate development as a business process encompassing
a range of activities such as the refurbishment of existing buildings
and neighborhoods, renovation, new building, land transactions and
homelessness management.

Development-led art is the art of housing struggle with a function of a
tool in efforts of different actors to establish dominion of the
exchange value of housing. It has generated various forms of art from
obedient bare art to the art of resistance. Critical artists are also a
part of this housingscape puzzle as they seek to dignify their position
in this unenviable situation by producing social, socially engaged, and
critical art, or by disobeying the parameters and rules set by
development-led art policy. Some of this art arose from existential
angst, some from guilt, while other work emerged from solidarity.

These artists seek to survive generalized crisis, attempting to reflect
on exclusionary forms of urban development and at the same time to make
a living from the development-led art. Artists have made works
denouncing injustices such as local social cleansing; they have
contributed to critical archiving and organized performances and
expeditions critical of the processes in which they themselves take
part. Some artists have sought to empower local communities while
participating in the process of their surrender to regeneration through
the slow museumification of their life and struggle. In other cases,
those open to joining the fight against social cleansing have managed to
contribute to it by spreading the word and sharing resources with local
communities, thus coming close to the more radical forms of art. Even
so, they must always remain cautious about quite how far they will go.
The danger is their art might have unwanted personal consequences such
as a loss of employment or job studio space or even homelessness.[^0Introduction_18]
There can be no doubt that the task of preventing developmentalist
attacks on local communities is much bigger than the power of art. The
pursuit of personal dignity is likewise a limiting goal. Nonetheless,
all these experiences should be acknowledged and learned from on the way
to joining existing movements against attacks on housing or building new
ones.

The art of housing struggle also happens in the (semi)autonomous
combative corners, cracks, and grey zones of housingscapes. Since the
global housing crisis of 2007–8 and its geographically uneven global
effects, the art of housing struggle has continued to engage with
radical forms of knowledge production and interventionism around housing
struggles and organizing with existing initiatives and housing
movements. This can mean taking action against evictions, rent-based
violence, etc.; the violence of housing commodification in all its
intersectional, class-belligerent, racialized, and gendered dimensions.
It implies an art in one-to-one correspondence with the world, ‘seeking
to escape performative and ontological capture as art altogether,’[^0Introduction_20]
or using them as a tool in struggle. Some instances of this art practice
are consciously undertaken as art; other practitioners reject the art
world altogether, while others again develop non-professional art
practices.

An *aesthetic of struggle* characteristic of these practices might best
be defined in terms of gestures that suggest allyship or complicity[^0Introduction_21]
(i.e., the condition shared by accomplices) with the communities in
struggle, whether or not ‘the privilege to co-opt social justice
ideologies’[^0Introduction_22] is acknowledged. In another sense the aesthetic of
struggle also uses an intracommunal lens to express the community’s
agency amid systemic inequity, creating experience that is not exhausted
in oppositionality, knowledge and desire, but instead discovers and
generates connections and tensions between the collective and singular,
the special and the mundane, as Felix Stalder and Cornelia Sollfrank
write in the introduction to their jointly edited volume *Aesthetic of
the Commons*. This art lives from a permanent process of
experimentation. It envisions and responds to the contemporary moment
not only as resistance ‘but also as “beautiful” – understanding beauty
as that which cannot be fully grasped conceptually nor be simply
consumed.’[^0Introduction_23]

One clear example of such an art practice is the *Kamendinamics* project
by cultural workers Nebojša Milikić and Tadej Kurepa of the Rex Cultural
center in Belgrade. It began with a series of conversations with tenants
of Kamendin social housing project, located in Zemun polje in Belgrade.
The neighborhood attracted public attention after racist protests from
neighboring blocks in response to an outbreak of scabies at a local
primary school. The protestors accused Roma tenants in Kamendin of
spreading the disease and demanded the city official to stop renting
flats in the area to Roma. Conversations with tenants soon reviled that
the real problem in the neighborhood was debt crises.

State and city officials used the racist unrest to speed up the eviction
of hundreds of tenants with outstanding debt resulting from inflated
utility bills imposed by the authorities themselves. Answering one
survey question, Kamendin tenant Zlatija Kostić declared herself a
culprit for her own and her family's predicament, saying she would sue
herself. Together with Nebojša Milikić and Tadej Kurepa and few other
Kamendin tenants facing eviction, Zlatija Kostić wrote a play in the
form of court records from Zlatija’s litigation against herself. Zlatija
the elder is suing Zlatija the younger over the difficult living
conditions and failures that brought her to the council flat in Kamendin
despite having worked all her life and under Yugoslavian law having the
right to home. The play ends up in a kind of forum theatre situation,
where the audience plays the jury. This creates an awkward feeling of
being a spectator as well as an accomplice in the situation.
Unfortunately, the play has only been performed once in Serbia, but the
project itself obtained significant publicity, helping the tenants to
build their case against the municipality. The struggle of the Kamendin
tenants continues.

How can we contextualize this specific art practice within the art
history of the Global East? What critical terms could we use to
understand this specific practice? Could the notion *radical* help in
conceptualizing this approach to art in any way? *Radical* *art* in the
interpretation of art in Serbia has been for a long time trapped in
artistic avant-gardism. In this approach, radical art is seen as
multiplicity of cultural practices stretching from the historic
avant-gardes to various postmodern post-avant-gardes, characterized by
artistic transgression, experiment and interdisciplinarity:[^0Introduction_24] the art
practices of the long 20^th^ century that constitute a mainstream in
today’s art world. Any attempt to reclaim the notion of radicality
becomes even more difficult bearing in mind the political use of the
word in Serbia. After 1989, the term became synonymous with the extreme
nationalism and fanaticism that now rules the country.[^0Introduction_25] How can we
reclaim the notion of the radical today? Is there a radical art practice
in Serbian or Yugoslav art history outside of these genealogies?

Rastko Močnik invokes the radical with reference to ‘the symbolic
production that was born out of the struggle for life and was perceived
by its producers as a weapon in the fight for freedom and
emancipation.’[^0Introduction_26] The culture construed here as weapon is the Partisan
culture and art that emerged in the Anti-Fascist People’s Liberation
Struggle of Yugoslavia in WWII. Močnik sees Partisan art as an
inextricable element of a wider project of political transformation,
whereas Miklavž Komelj argues that Partisan art invented a new kind of
post-bourgeois artistic autonomy. There is no consensus on the
historical origins of this art (its respective relations, for example,
to Socialist Realism and the avant-gardes), but there can be no doubt
that Partisan art as art of political experiment created a radically new
sense of what is historically possible. It is precisely this aspect that
makes it essential for the contemporary Art of the Housing Struggle. As
Boris Buden wrote in a review of Gal Kirn’s book *Partizan
Brake* (Partizanski prelomi): ‘It is not about past at all, but rather
about our own historical present and its radical openness to different
futures.’[^0Introduction_27]

It is generally agreed that the one-party system of post-war Yugoslavia
betrayed the political promise of Partisan art.[^0Introduction_28] The conception
of radical amateurism nonetheless stands out in regional art history as
one instrument worth revisiting within the genealogy of radicality.

The usefulness of this notion, as Aleksandra Sekulić describes it, is
that it draws attention to the political, social, and cultural context
of Yugoslav cultural and artistic practices rarely mentioned in standard
art historiography.[^0Introduction_29] Aldo Milohnić writes about this practice as
something opposed to the ideal of autonomous art cherished by the
cultural elites of the time. Unburdened by aesthetic concerns, this art
turned towards political intervention, towards participation in a
‘spontaneous ideology of radical interventionism in cultural, social and
political spheres of Yugoslav society.’[^0Introduction_30] This artistic and political
dilettantism allowed artists-amateurs to ask questions that are not
usually asked. Such is the example of the short documentary film from
1971 entitled *Black Film* by Želimir Žilnik. In the middle of the
night, the camera follows Žilnik in the town of Novi Sad where he
encounters a group of homeless *lumpenproletariat*. Contrary to the
official narratives in Yugoslavia that claimed that there is no
homelessness, this film sheds light on this issue as Žilnik offers these
people to stay in the two-bedroom flat with his family. Is it possible
to make a continuity with such practice after Yugoslavia? With the
disappearance of Yugoslav cultural infrastructure, radical amateurism
became a rare phenomenon. Thus, today we can no longer speak of radical
amateurism as an alternative culture, but we *can* speak of radical art
practice as form of access, as embodied day-to-day resistance from
margins and an element of a movement culture (if such a thing does
indeed exist).

Building on Michele Lancione’s invitation to expand
the radical housing politics by including minor activisms and exploring
creative methodologies,[^0Introduction_31] I propose the term *radical housing art*
for art made by tenants and communities and also for experimental
artistic practices that take part in producing radical housing politics
against and beyond the development(alist) matrix. Lancione advocates for
radical housing ‘as a gateway to challenge wider structural forms of
violence, including patriarchy, racism, class exploitation, and, of
course, deprivation of shelter.’[^0Introduction_32] Radical politics is not an
exclusive product of Westernized masculine movements with grand
narratives, but of mundane acts of subversion made and un-made at the
level of everyday dwelling practices and generative power of radical
movements that take desperation seriously; desperation as political in
itself.[^0Introduction_33]

Struggle has been central to the politics of radical housing art, by
means of which histories have been reclaimed from below and new
infrastructures of care have been built beyond the valorizing structures
of art world, accompanied by efforts to facilitate exchange of skills
and to raise awareness of multiple possible futures. On this journey,
art has been an important tool in thinking about new ways of living and
relating to housing and home and mobilizing against housing
dispossession. Radical housing art practice also raises questions about
whose art counts, and although it has been unable to change the
globalized art world, it has managed to create temporary spaces where it
is the people’s art that counts.

However, radical housing art is not an isolated practice, and the method
of *categorical isolation,*[^0Introduction_34] as Marina Vishmidt and Kerstin
Stakemeier describe it, must be overcome if we are to understand its
potentials and pitfalls. It emerges in a complex network of actors
entering housing-related fields from art, the non-profit sector, the
state, the private sector, and different social and housing movements.
Relations between these various actors have significantly shaped and
complicated the meaning, scope, and effects of the radical housing art
practices. These art practices and their field are not static or fixed.
They have their own dynamics, and it is therefore important to assess
them in relation to social, political, economic, and cultural
developments on an ongoing basis. They are dynamic and processual, and
their constellations change over time and space. If an art practice
functions as radical housing art at one moment, this doesn’t mean the
same will be true when the constellations have changed. That is why it
is important to always allow the process of communal becoming to teach
us. Radical housing art has its common challenges and common failures,
and the role of all of us who fight for homes is to hold one another
accountable, as well as to remain aware of the beauty of art that moves
from tragic to joyful.

## Thinking Radical Housing Collectively

*At its core it is about radical humility and making ourselves
vulnerable to each other, listening in more ethical ways, overcoming our
fear of asking questions, and being OK with not knowing the
answers.*[^0Introduction_35]

– Patricia DeRocher

Though I knew some of them from before, I met most of the contributors
to this book at the Art and Housing Struggles: Between Art and Political
Organizing conference, which I co-organized with Elena Marchevska and
Chris Jones at London South Bank University in June 2018. [^0Introduction_36] This
conference had two main focuses: global and local. It set out to ask
difficult questions about the place of art in the housingscape and its
role in ongoing battles worldwide. Besides the session with papers, the
conference included two workshops by people whose work was formative to
me. Nebojša Milikić and Zlatija Kostić organized a workshop where we all
took part in collative reading of their piece, *I Sued My Self*. Dont
Rhin, sound artist and popular educator, gave a workshop where he
invited participants to reflect on their experiences with gentrification
violence. This workshop introduced a framework for transforming
experience into an investigation that takes action in the world, based
on his work with the School of Echoes Los Angeles that resulted in
forming the L. A. Tenants’ Union.

London South Bank University is in dangerous proximity to Elephant and
Castle Shopping Centre and Aylesbury Estate, both undergoing social
cleansing at the time. That urgent matter and our own involvement with
local initiatives against social cleansing in the area made us
concentrate on local struggles in London and practices developed by
collectives working and organizing with local communities. On the final
day of our encounter, Emer Mary Morris and Nina Scott from the You
Should See the Other Guy theatre group talked about the practice they
developed in housing struggle during the occupation with Focus E15 Mums
group. Hannan Majid from the Rainbow Collective and Ledbury Action group
talked about the work with children in South East London as part of the
latter; a housing campaign created as an emergency response to unsafe
and appalling housing conditions on their Council estate. AHHAAHHA from
Voices that Shake! talked about their work with youth against social
injustice and connections of racial violence, body trauma, and art. Zena
Edwards introduced her artistic practice fusing poetry in music to
create a soundtrack against racial injustice in the city.

Learning from this encounter, the book provides a composite cartography
of modes of thinking and acting around the art of housing struggle. It
is a mosaic of interventions that emerge from contradictory traditions,
and as a result it proposes heterogeneous orientations. What connects
these contributions is thinking from or within the periphery. These
peripheries are not located only in the Global South[^0Introduction_37] and the Global
East but also in the Global North’s internal margins. It is in these
sights of resistance against housing precarity that radical housing is
traced as it emerges, declines, and re-emerges on the way to our common
future. The book is divided into five sections. Each section contains
essays with a particular focus. The pieces are thought-provoking
commentaries on new and old modes of theorizing, thinking, and making
art in the midst of housing struggles. Though the authors don’t engage
directly with the notion of radical housing, this essay collection
raises questions about how to produce knowledge and how to do art about
and from housing struggles in a radical way.

What is radical politics today, and how to foster radical housing
politics at a time of unsettled relations between the accumulation of
capital, new forms of social reproduction, new social and housing
movements, and the need to rethink the past and envision alternatives?
In what way does radical care emerge as a driving force within radical
housing movements and resistance at the margins? Can we theorize,
criticize, and make art with care or can we care critically? How to
write our own insurgent histories radically, and how to keep these
histories alive? By what means and with what politics to build tenants’
power and housing commons against social cleansing, oppressive forms of
housing, urban real estate and artwashing? These are just some of the
questions that arise from the essays, between lines and in footnotes,
and in ongoing conversations happening as we speak, implicitly or
explicitly. The book also raises the issue of knowledge production in
Western institutions tackling housing violence and radical housing
politics. The argument is made against white colonial institutions and
the uncomfortable truth about how these institutions have always treated
minoritized people.

The first section, *Insurgent History and Radical Care*, starts with
*The Land of Three Towers,* a theatre performance script by the
London-based theatre group You Should See the Other Guy. Their script
tells the story about the occupation of Carpenters Estate by the Focus
E15 Mums, a group of young single mothers threatened with eviction, who
ran the tower block as a social center for two weeks. This play is about
preserving the history of this struggle and sharing experience with
other tenants in London that fight housing regeneration. The second
essay, ‘Against disappearance: A partial cartography of Vila Autódromo's
resistance against eviction,’ seeks to underline care as a political
practice in the art of housing struggle, by elaborating care and its
capacity to disobey power. Cristina Ribas and Lucas Ico’s reflection on
their project *Vocabulary in the Movement* was built with the residents
of Vila Autódromo, who have been resisting eviction in Rio for many
years. Their writing of the insurgent history reveals care as the
practice that gives tissue to collective structures in the coexistence
of self-care, care for the family, care for the neighborhood, and care
for surroundings and nature.

The first text in the second section, *Fighting Artwashing and Building
Tenant Power* is by the Southwark Notes group from south-east London,
which has been organizing and writing against gentrification in their
area for more than 20 years. In their essay, they give an insight into
the struggles against social cleansing, including artwashing, from the
messy perspective of the struggle itself. In their contribution, they
ask difficult questions and look at the complicated decisions made
across many local groups and campaigns in the fight against artwashing
and for the right to a home. This is followed by a contribution from the
Los Angeles School of Echoes, ‘Flipping the script on artwashing:
Fighting gentrification with tenants’ power,’ a multi-racial and
cross-generational collective of organizers, teachers, and artists
dedicated to tenants’ struggles in their hometown. They tease out three
scripts used in art-oriented development and consider action to flip
these scripts through tenant power, based on their own experience on the
ground. This is followed with the text ‘Hegemony and Socially-Engaged
Art: The case of project Row Houses, Houston, Texas, USA’ by Alyssa
Erspamer, which starts from the marginal to modernity concept(s) of
cultural hegemony to discuss the Raw Houses social art project created
by US artist Rick Lowe. Erspamer tackles artwashing mechanisms for the
current hegemony and counter-hegemonic potential of art.

The section *Politics of the Past and Politics of the Future* continues
with the article ‘Complicities, solidarities and everything in
between. Art and political engagement in the housing movement in
Bucharest and Cluj.’** **Ioana Florea and Veda Popovici write from the
complicated position of activists, artists, and theoreticians about
walking the thin line of solidarity with the dispossessed in housing
struggles, mostly Roma people, and their (un)wanted connection with the
real-estate market. By focusing on the post-1989 period and the
emergence of a new class of restitution landlords, they reveal how
community art projects prepared grounds for an enduring housing movement
still active today. ‘Art in the Interim: How the issue of the
restitution of housing in unified Berlin led to an artistic
reimagination of the city’ develops an important insight into the
phenomenon of interim housing use during the periods of crisis and the
so-called transition in post-socialism. In this essay, Nicola Guy looks
into vacant buildings under restitution used by the producers of
autonomous and institutionalized art exhibitions, after the Berlin Wall
fell in 1989. Guy seeks to understand the impact of restitution on the
art scene and ways in which art has been utilized both in the
real-estate industry and as a tool for the city of Berlin to reimagine
itself.

The section *Narrowing the Space and Mourning the Losses* starts with a
contribution by Josephine Berry and Anthony Iles: ‘The Exploitation of
Isolation: Urban Development and the Artist’s Studio.’ They examine the
five stages of the artistic studio's genealogy: from the isolated
studio, the factory studio, open or community studio and the networked
studio, to the pop-up studio. They show how the forms have developed
both in relation to and at a distance from the housing market and
real-estate industry. With this contribution, the authors show how
housing and studios have been merging into live-work arrangements,
making and remaking artists as potentially rebellious (and
revolutionary) subjects that have tried to negotiate, make compromises,
and eventually become the often-unwilling accomplices of social
cleansing. The section ends with a contribution by Sylvi Kretzschmar
exploring the potentials for art in dealing with loss in housing
struggles. Kretzschmar reflects on the Morning Machine performance,
which features twelve women with megaphones amplifying a set of
interview-statements of former residents at the demolished Esso Houses
estate in Hamburg. Kretzschmar writes about the necessity of amplifying
grief in dealing with the failures of the struggle as a means of
empowering people in the movement.

The book ends with a section on *Patterns of Commoning and Working with
Dirt*. Here, Andreea S. Micu reflects on the role of art in Metropoliz,
a squat on the periphery of Rome that provides a home for over three
hundred people, mostly immigrants from Morocco, Tunisia, Eritrea, Sudan,
Poland, Peru, the Dominican Republic, Ukraine, Romania, and for
working-class people from Italy. She examines the role of art in the
commodification of urban commons by looking at the MAAM (Museum of the
Other and the Elsewhere). In looking at the Metropoliz-MAAM relation,
she redefines commons as radical differences and irreducible plurality.
This is followed by the text written by Filip Jovanovski, Ivana Vaseva,
and Kristina Lelovac, elaborating on the histories of struggle over the
site of the Railway Residential Building, a socialist housing estate in
Skopje. In this script, the authors explore the problems of dwelling
together and managing common spaces during the Yugoslav, anti-Yugoslav,
and post-Yugoslav period. The book ends with a provocation by AHHAAHHA
that raises essential issues about knowledge production in academia
tackling housing violence. This contribution raises a point about the
need to find ways to produce knowledge that will allow for the messiness
of our lives to speak up and make new institutional arrangements against
the class, race, and gender divide.

In this publication cultural theorists, activists, organizers, and
artists engage with struggles and art practices to provide building
blocks for understanding radical housing. In their writings, they
respond to the imperative to change how we do housing and how to
practice art in difficult situations when life is at stake, including
one’s own. This kind of messy art practice demands messy theory and a
messy process of thought.[^0Introduction_38] But beyond advocating messy knowledge
production against formalized academic ways of thinking, a few writers
also argue for creating the conditions for producing knowledge from
struggle and from dirt. From development-led art to radical housing art
this book advocates staying with the difficulties, namely, thinking
through the existential and material contradictions of artists and
tenants trapped between the struggle for decent housing and the
exceptional requirements of artistic production.

[^0Introduction_8]: My perspective has a foothold in the Global East art –
    particularly the art from ex-Yugoslav region – as well as in
    Yugoslav housing experiments that has brought a historically new
    type of societal property (a property without proprietor) and
    self-management as a form of a direct democracy in managing housing.
    Although there were many challenges that were not met in the way it
    was promised, this history has a potential of a prospective that
    could – with a proper critical reassessment – bring useful knowledge
    against capitalist cancelation of the future.
